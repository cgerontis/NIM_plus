The vhdl code can be found here:

DAC_Control.vhd(link below) was written by Alan G Prosser from Fermilab, and is used to set the DAC, however we still need to figure out how to use this code
https://github.com/cgerontis/NIM_plus/tree/master/ANOTHER_AND_GATE/ANOTHER_AND_GATE.srcs/sources_1/imports/Desktop

The code here (https://github.com/cgerontis/NIM_plus/tree/master/ANOTHER_AND_GATE/ANOTHER_AND_GATE.srcs/sources_1/new) is test code that attempts to accomplish the same thing as the DAC_Control code in a simpler way, however it is hardcoded

Note: The repository still has to be cleaned up and names must be updated
